Data structure is a key component in computer science and is essential for building efficient algorithms. It is always at the core of the curriculum in related majors. This course aims to reveal the principles and methods of various data structures, as well as the main techniques for algorithm design and performance analysis. The topics covered range from basic data structures to recent research results.

The blogs here are based on the course materials of Data Structure and Algorithm of Tsinghua University.
